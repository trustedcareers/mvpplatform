# 🧪 Validation Guide: Personalized Contract Analysis

## 🗄️ **Step 1: Database Setup**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to SQL Editor > New Query
   - Copy and paste the SQL from `node setup-review-summary-table.js`
   - Run the query to create the `review_summary` table and add `contract_excerpt` column

2. **Verify Tables Exist**
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('review_summary', 'review_results', 'user_context', 'contract_documents');
   ```

## 🚀 **Step 2: Start Development Server**

```bash
cd trusted-app
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 **Step 5: Common Issues & Debugging**

### **Database Issues**
```bash
# Check if tables exist

```

### **PDF Extraction Issues**
- Check terminal logs for "extractTextFromFile" messages
- Verify PDF is readable (not image-based or encrypted)
- Test with a simple text-based PDF first

### **OpenAI Issues**

- Check terminal for OpenAI API errors
- Fallback mock data should work if API fails

### **Authentication Issues**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check Supabase RLS policies are created
- Verify user_id matches in database
